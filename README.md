Hi there! I am a software developer and architect by heart. 
- I want to learn, get better and share the knowledge!
- I love the possibilities that the development of software provides!
- I love thinking in patterns and systems and figuring out the best approach to a solution!

_Keep it simple!_ :heavy_check_mark:
